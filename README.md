## Machine Learning

### Summary

Project repository for Télécom Paris MS Big Data INF729 *Apache Spark with Scala* course. Project goal is use Apache Spark, Spark ML and Scala for:

- Extracting continuous, categorical and text features from a Kaggle dataset of successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns
- Predicting the success (or not) of future Kickstarter projects with supervised Learning algorithms

Repository contains two Scala files:

- `Preprocessor`: Scala functions for preprocessing the Kickstarter dataset
- `Trainer`: using Spark ML's Scala API for training a Logistic Regression, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting. For Logistic Regression, hyperparameter optimization with grid search was used
